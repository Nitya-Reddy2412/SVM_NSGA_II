## Abstract Summary

The paper proposes a **multi-objective metaheuristic approach** based on **NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II)** that integrates **Feature Selection (FS)** into a **soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to optimize both:
1. **Predictive performance**
2. **Computational efficiency**

### Key Innovation
Unlike prior methods with static FS, this approach **dynamically selects features** to approximate the Pareto-optimal frontier, balancing structural and empirical risk.

## Problem Statement

### The Curse of Dimensionality
- SVMs trained on large datasets with many features suffer from:
  - Decreased efficiency
  - Increased computational complexity
  - Risk of overfitting
  - Sparse data points in high-dimensional space

### Need for Feature Selection
- Reduces number of dimensions
- Improves model efficiency
- Enhances interpretability
- Prevents performance degradation

## Main Contributions

### 1. **Novel Solution Representation**
- Direct encoding of hyperplanes (weights + intercept)
- Expands search space compared to previous methods
- Three chromosomes per individual:
  - π₁: Selected feature identifiers (size 4 to d)
  - π₂: Weights for selected features (continuous values)
  - π₃: Intercept value (single continuous value)

### 2. **Specialized Genetic Operators**
- **Crossover**: Adapted partially mapped crossover for features
- **Mutation Operator 1**: Modifies values (features, weights, intercepts)
- **Mutation Operator 2**: Changes number of features (add/remove)
- Both operators use decay probabilities over iterations

### 3. **Weighted Optimization Strategy**
- Includes parameter αᵢ to weight classification errors by class prevalence
- Handles dataset imbalances effectively

### 4. **Dynamic Feature Selection**
- Number of features adjusts dynamically (constraint: Σtⱼ ≤ d)
- Unlike prior work with fixed 5 features

### 5. **Parameter Tuning**
- Three distinct versions (NSGA-II1, NSGA-II2, NSGA-II3)
- Each optimized for different metrics:
  - NSGA-II1: Optimized for AUC-ROC
  - NSGA-II2: Optimized for F-Score
  - NSGA-II3: Optimized for Cohen's Kappa Coefficient (CKC)

## Mathematical Model

### Objectives
- **Objective 1** (Structural Risk): minimize f₁ = ½‖w‖²
- **Objective 2** (Empirical Risk): minimize f₂ = Σᵢ∈N αᵢξᵢ

### Constraints
- yᵢ(wᵀxᵢ + b) ≥ 1 - ξᵢ  ∀i∈N
- |wⱼ| ≤ Mtⱼ  ∀j∈D
- Σⱼ∈D tⱼ ≤ d (dynamic feature constraint)
- Domain constraints for decision variables

## Algorithm Components

### NSGA-II Framework
1. **Initial Population**: Random generation with predefined ranges
2. **Selection**: Tournament selection based on dominance
3. **Crossover**: Partially mapped crossover with L subdivisions
4. **Mutation**: Two operators with decaying probabilities (ρ¹ₜ, ρ²ₜ)
5. **Non-dominated Sorting**: Fast-non-dominated-sort operator
6. **Crowding Distance**: Maintains diversity in Pareto front

### Mutation Decay
- ρʰₜ₊₁ = ρʰₜ × Bᵗ where B = 0.999
- Inspired by simulated annealing
